# Kiosk

This Project contains all the code for the CEM/CE kiosk located out side the CEM/CE office
at OSU in Kearny hall. The pourpose of this project is so people who are passing by
or are here visiting can see what CEM/CE is all about and relive memoreies they may have 
had at the college. There is also a nice feature that allows you to look at a map of the
OSU campus. Ideally this map would be interactive and allow people to look for things
but currently it is static.

## TODO
--Refactor JS code out of HTML files
--Refactor Placement of PHOTOS along with removing redundent photos
--Refactor CSS out of HTML Files.
--Add in New Photos.
--See if we can do an interactive map.
--May consider new features.
